Active Particles: Particles That do Non-local Feedback
======================================================

The particles described in :ref`star_particles` for the most part do feedback entirely local to a grid. This presents difficulty when one wants to do a more sophisticated form of feedback, for example a sing particle that can accrete gas from more than one grid, or a particle that can shines radiation. Active particles are a software framework for developing new particles and running simulations that include particles that run complex non-local feedback or formation algorithms.
