This is a cosmology simulation in which a radiation particle is activated at 
z = 50. The spectrum and strength of the source is set in the parameter file.
Some scripts are attached that can test the output. Note that the 
results will depend on the radiation solver/species solver used. 
You will need to specify the position of the RadiationParticle and 
it's starting redshift in a seperate file (RadiationSourcePosition.txt).

Usage:
./inits.exe -d ActiveRadiationParticle.inits
mpirun -np 2 ./ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
mpirun -np 2 ./enzo.exe -d ActiveRadiationParticle.enzo

Low Resolution version:

A lower resolution version also exists which runs in a couple of minutes on two cores. 
The usage is very similar to above.

Usage:
./inits.exe -d ActiveRadiationParticle_lowres.inits
mpirun -np 2 ./ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
mpirun -np 2 ./enzo.exe -d ActiveRadiationParticle_lowres.enzo
