CollapseTestActiveParticles
------------------------

This test problem is similar to CollapseTestActiveParticles, but with some key
differences.

It initializes two constant density spheres at the center of the box with radius
of 0.15 of the box width.  The two spheres are offset in the x direction and
given an initial velocity in the +y direction.  The spheres are gravitationally
unstable and will collapse and form sink particles.

The advection is used to test momentum conservation in the sink particle.  There
are two spheres to test code paths that are only executed when there are more
than one particle.

This test runs to completion (t = 1) and produces 10 outputs in roughly 2-4
minutes on a single processor.  Active particles start forming after t = 0.35 or
so.  In plot.py, we plot the evolution of the peak density versus time create
density projections for each output.
