CollapseTestActiveParticles
------------------------

This test problem is similar to CollapseTestNonCosmological, but will
form active particles above a density threshold of 5000 cm^-3.

It initializes a constant density sphere at the center of the box with
radius of 0.15 of the box width.  The sphere is in pressure
equilibrium with its surroundings.  The sphere will collapse
dynamically and reach its peak density at t ~ 5.2 in code units.
Radiative cooling is turned off, so the sphere will bounce and reach
an equilibrium state.

This test runs to completion (t = 15) and produces 16 outputs in
roughly 3-5 minutes on a single processor.  Active particles start
forming after t = 13.  In plot.py, we plot the evolution of the peak
density versus time create density projections for each output.

Note for comparing with Enzo 1.5 - By default, Enzo 2.0 performs 4
iterations of the multigrid gravity solver (configurable with the
PotentialIterations parameter).  However, the default number of
potential iteration in Enzo 1.5 is 0 and there is no parameter to
change this.  For a direct comparison, Enzo 1.5 must be compiled with
MAX_POTENTIAL_ITERATIONS (in macros_and_parameters.h) set to 4.
