CollapseTestActiveParticles
------------------------

This test problem is similar to CollapseTestNonCosmological, but will
form active particles above a density threshold of 500 in internal units.

It initializes a constant density sphere at the center of the box with
radius of 0.15 of the box width.  The sphere is in pressure
equilibrium with its surroundings.

This test runs to completion (t = 10) and produces 20 outputs in
roughly 3-5 minutes on a single processor.  Active particles start
forming after t = 5 or so.  In plot.py, we plot the evolution of the peak
density versus time create density projections for each output.
